# Depth-Aware-RGB-and-IR-Image-Alignment-Using-ToF-Based-Homography-Interpolation
This paper presents a depth-aware method for accurate pixel-wise registration of RGB and infrared (IR) images using Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensing


1)
2)(ir lin) This script computes a depth-dependent homography from ToF (e.g., Blaze) to RGB camera images.
It takes corner detections from multiple depths, fits a linear model for each homography matrix element,
and outputs the equations as a function of depth.
